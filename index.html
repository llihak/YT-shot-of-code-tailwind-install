              <p>Fulgent AI is a robust Artificial Intelligence Engine developed specifically for trading. It uses
                hundreds of
                indicators and cross-market measurements over long-term historical stock market data to produce accurate
                trading
                opportunities.</p>
              <p>Fulgent AI for MetaStock comes with the FT Stocks and provides four different kinds of trading signals:
              </p>
              <p><b>Major Market Reversals</b> – Trained to identify those unique times when a stock is oversold and
                other
                forces, including cross-market indicators, provide evidence of a strong move. Wide, intelligent stops
                are used
                to capture as much profit as possible.<br></p>
              <p><b>Classic Swing Trades </b> – Looks for classic “Reversion” Swing Trades. The intelligent Exits
                establish
                Stops below the lows of a move and look to take profits on the upper boundary of a Swing.<br></p>
              <p><b>Quick (3-Day) Moves</b> – Trained to maximize profits 3 bars after the Entry. This makes a great
                Strategy
                for active traders looking to trade the very quick explosive moves that often happen when volatility
                increases.
              </p>
              <p><b>Volatility Breakouts</b> – Trained to find “Volatility Breakouts” - potential moves indicated by
                unusually
                high volatility in the direction of the breakout. These kinds of trades typically run for several bars
                before
                hitting resistance. The Strategy employs a moderate Trailing Profit Exit to encourage trades to reach
                their
                “apex” before signaling an Exit.</p>
              <p>Simple by Design<br>With Fulgent AI there is no need to decide which Signal type to look for. The
                Expert
                Advisor will explain each Signal identified, in addition to showing where the Stops from the Strategy
                are placed
                on each bar. Because four different AI Strategies are provided, traders receive a target-rich
                environment every
                trading day.</p>
              <p>Fulgent AI has been designed to provide clear, actionable Signals without the need for Interpretation
                using
                additional indicators. MetaStock users can leverage their success with other Add-Ons by starting with
                Signals
                from Fulgent, and confirming them with the other techniques they are familiar with.</p>
              <p>For those running System Tests on Fulgent AI, a simple control is available from the Tools Menu to
                increase the
                Minimum Signal Rating, so the AI generates fewer, higher-performing Signals. You can also click “Show
                All” to
                see All Trade Ideas generated by the AI.</p>
              <p>Because Artificial Intelligence is used, a single Component is all that is required for each function
                in
                MetaStock that is accessible from the Power Console:</p>

              <h4 class="full">About Ed Downs</h4>
              <p>Ed Downs, Software Engineer and veteran trader, launched Fulgent Technologies in 2019, using AI
                technology
                developed by Nirvana Systems, Inc. from 1996 through 2018. Over the past 22 years, Mr. Downs has led his
                team to
                apply AI methods to intelligently identify the many high-probability opportunities that appear every day
                in
                freely-traded markets.</p>
              <p>Anyone who has traded for an extended period of time knows there is no single indicator or collection
                of
                indicators that can provide profitable Trade Ideas in all market conditions. Traders deal with this
                reality by
                watching for events to alert them to the fact that the personality of the market is likely to change, so
                they
                can adjust accordingly. An intelligent approach is needed that can adapt its Trading Signals as the
                market
                changes.</p>
              <p>The goal of Fulgent AI is to provide the best possible Trade Ideas for the end-user. Fulgent applies
                classic AI
                methods, including Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, and Fuzzy Logic to identify key indicators of
                price
                movement through the combination of hundreds of market factors, measured over decades of historical
                data.</p>
              <p>Because of its simple yet powerful Expert Advisor, Fulgent AI is great for beginning traders looking
                for a list
                of great Trade Ideas each day. But it is also ideal for the more seasoned MetaStock user who wants to
                take
                advantage of AI-based Signals in a platform they have learned to trade successfully in. Using Fulgent AI
                as a
                signal source can dramatically enhance the effectiveness of indicators the user has come to rely on,
                including
                those from other Add-Ons developed for the MetaStock Platform.</p>
